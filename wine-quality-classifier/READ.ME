# Wine Quality Classifier


## Overview

Wine Quality Classifier is a Python script that implements various classification models to predict wine quality based on its chemical characteristics. The project uses a CSV dataset that contains information about red wines and their quality ratings.


## Features

- Importing and reading a CSV file.
- Data preprocessing (separating attributes and labels).
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms:
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Network (MLP)
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Gaussian Process Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation of each model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn


## Usage

- Google Colab
	1. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
	2. Mount your Google Drive to access the CSV file.
	3. Ensure the winequality-red.csv file is in your Google Drive at the specified path (/content/drive/My Drive/wine+quality/winequality-red.csv).
	4. Paste the script code into the notebook.
	5. Run the cells to train the models and view the results.


## Results
After execution, the script will display:
	- Accuracy of each model.
	- Classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
	- Confusion matrix for detailed analysis.
