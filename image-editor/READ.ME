# READ.ME Webcam Filter Effects


## Overview

The Webcam Filter Effects project is a Python script designed to apply various filters to a live webcam video stream in Google Colab. The script captures video from the webcam, processes it with different effects (enhancement, sepia, and oil painting), and displays the filtered frames.


## Features

- Captures live video from the webcam.
- Applies multiple filters to enhance or transform the video feed.
- Displays original and processed frames with OpenCV in a Colab notebook.
- Real-time interaction with the video stream using JavaScript and Python integration.
- Filters Available:
	Enhancement Filter: Applies a detail enhancement by subtracting a blurred version of the frame from the original, creating a sharper, more detailed image.
	Sepia Filter: Applies a classic sepia tone to the image, giving it a warm, vintage look.
	Oil Painting Filter: Transforms the image into a painterly effect, mimicking the style of an oil painting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Google Colab (for seamless webcam integration and display)


## Usage
- Start Video Stream: The video_stream() function initializes and starts capturing video from your webcam.
- Apply Filters: The script automatically applies the enhancement, sepia, and oil painting filters to the webcam frames.
- View Results: The original and filtered frames are displayed within the Colab notebook using cv2_imshow().
- Stop Video Stream: After processing, the video stream is stopped automatically.
